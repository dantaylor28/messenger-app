# Messenger Chat App

A full-stack messenger application that allows users to send and receive text and picture messages in real time. Users can create their own profile with the added functionality to update your personal details and profile image. This project is fully responsive, allowing users the ability to use it on various different screen sizes from mobile to extra large computer screens. The project utilises a Node.js and MongoDB backend and React on the frontend while TailwindCSS is used for styling.
